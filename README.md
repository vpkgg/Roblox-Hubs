# Roblox-Hubs
This repository includes multiple hubs, i will try and update whenever i can.

This repository includes some of the best hubs (doesn't include many for now)

# How to download

First go to the green button with the word code on it, click it then download as a .Zip file.
Secondly extract it on your pc.

# Client 

check "Clients to use" if you need a client
check "Clients to use" if you need a client
check "Clients to use" if you need a client

Open the client, then go to the games.txt in each hub folder and see if it has the game you want, if not try another. If none of the clients have a script you want try my other repository https://github.com/vpkgg/Roblox-Scripts

Once you have your hub/script press the open file button in your client (you may have to look around for it)

Then find the .txt or .lua file and once it is in the client press execute (ovs inject first)

Boom done
